The rest of this repo is under the MIT license, but this directory contains patches and build scripts that were modified from https://github.com/devernay/osmesa-install/, which is under the GPL3. Hence, these scripts are also GPL licensed. My understanding is that this particular software is only used for the build itself and doesn't get linked in to the rest of the code _per se_, so therefore can exist in a separately licensed state. If this is incorrect, someone please let me know.
